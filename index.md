I'm in the final stage of my PhD at the University of Sydney. I am apart of the [Behavioural Ecology and Conservation Research Group](https://conservation-behaviour.sydney.edu.au/) and the [Integrative Ecology lab](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/our-research/research-areas/life-and-environmental-sciences/integrative-ecology-lab.html). My general research interests are in parasite and disease ecology, urban ecology, small mammal ecology, human-wildlife conflict, and wildlife conservation.

My PhD research focuses on understanding the _ecological_ drivers of human-tick encounters. Native bandicoots are widely considered the primary hosts of ticks that cause problems for people and pets, so my research set out to better understand the ecology of ticks in urban areas. My primary research aims were to (1) determine the spatial patterns in reported tick encounters and relationships between encounters and reported backyard traits, wildlife sightings and landscape traits, (2) identify the key small mammal hosts by quantifying host abundance and tick abundance on hosts, and (3) understand small mammal host behaviour at the urban fringe. Together, my research findings will inform tick management strategies.

I've used a range of techniques to answer my research questions including small mammal trapping, camera trapping, wildlife anaesthesia and community-based questionnaires.
 
Before my PhD, I completed a **Bachelor of Animal and Veterinary Bioscience** with First Class Honours at The University of Sydney. During my undergradate degree, I developed a strong interest in wildlife, parasites and disease which led me to major in Animal Health and Disease. My Honours project explored the use of Infrared thermography as a tool to measure inflammation and pain in beef calves undergoing routine husbandry procedures. This project sparked my passion for research, but it was a 6-month program with **Conservation Volunteers Australia** after Honours that led me back to ecology.
