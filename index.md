I'm a PhD candidate based at the University of Sydney. I am apart of the Behavioural Ecology and Conservation Research Group and the Integrative Ecology lab. My research focuses on understanding the ecological drivers of human-tick encounters with a focus on the relationship between small mammals and ticks in urban areas.
