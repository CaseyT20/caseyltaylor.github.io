I'm a PhD candidate in the final stages of my thesis write-up at the University of Sydney. I am apart of the Behavioural Ecology and Conservation Research Group and the Integrative Ecology lab. 

My research focuses on understanding the ecological drivers of human-tick encounters with a focus on the relationship between small mammals and ticks in urban areas. Native bandicoots are widely considered the primary hosts of ticks that cause problems for people and pets, so my research set out to identify the key ticks hosts to better inform tick management.
My PhD research has combines my interests in wildlife, parasites, ecology and human-wildlife conflict using a range of techniques from small mammal trapping, camera trapping, and wildlife anaesthesia to study tick-host relationships, to the use of online surveys to map human-tick encounters and relate these to backyard traits, wildlife observations and broader landscape traits.

Before commencing my PhD research, I completed a Bachelor of Animal and Veterinary Bioscience with First Class Honours at The University of Sydney. During my undergradate degree, I developed a strong interest in wildlife, parasites and disease which led me to major in Animal Health and Disease. I went on to do an Honours project exploring the use of Infrared thermography as a tool to measure inflammation and pain in beef calves undergoing routine husbandry procedures. While my love for research began during my Honours year, it was a 6-month gap post-Honours that led me back to ecology.

In my time between Honours and my PhD, I completed a 6-month program with Conservation Volunteers Australia focused on restoring of a degraded section of the Nepean River. Through this program I reconnected with my love for nature and went on the hunt for a PhD involving wildlife and ecology.
