Though I am currently finishing my thesis, I recently received funding along with my PhD supvisors Professor Peter Banks and Professor Dieter Hochuli to build on some of our research on tick ecology, including some of the findings that emerged during my PhD research.

Wihth fnding from the [Hermon Slade Foundation](http://www.hermonslade.org.au/) we will be exploring the role of introduced black rats in urban tick dynamics.

The Australian paralysis tick (_Ixodes holocyclus_), is a generalist and can feed on many species. But our recent work shows that introduced black rats (_Rattus rattus_) are abundant in urban tick hot spots, host high numbers of juvenile Australian ticks, and may play a key role in driving urban tick dynamics.

In this project, we will study the role of black rats in urban tick dynamics to understand how an abundant invasive species shapes parasite ecology. Black rats are common in peri-urban bushland and backyards where residents regularly encounter ticks. However, we lack the knowledge required to make evidence-informed decisions around managing ticks.

Our project tests three key hypotheses:
1) That black rats amplify local tick populations (or alternatively act as ecological traps through grooming) 
2) That black rats move regularly between bushland and backyards
3) That a local rat removal program will lead to a reduction in tick abundance

Solutions to prevent tick-borne public health risks are embedded in our understanding of tick ecology. By testing these hypotheses, we will definitively reveal the importance of a global commensal in maintaining urban tick populations, inform management of black rats in urban bushland by studying their movement and determine whether large-scale rat control is a viable tick management strategy.
