**Undergraduate teaching**

_Life and Evolution_, Demonstrator, The University of Sydney (2019-2021)

I've worked as a demonstrator in practical classes for Life and Evolution - a first year biology course - and supervised exams, marked exams, and marked scientific reports. Due to COVID-19, the practical classes were delivered online, so we had to adapt to teaching remotely and heavily relying on technology. 

_Tropical Wildlife Biology_, Demonstrator, The University of Sydney (2019 & 2020)
I worked as a demonstrator on a 1-week intensive field course located at Mary River Park in the Northern Territory, Australia. In this course, we showed students how to conduct wildlife surveys, how to identify wild animals - with an emphasis on amphibians and reptiles - and we mentored the students through the design and completion of a field experiment.

_Ecology & Conservation_, Demonstrator, The University of Sydney. (2021)                                                

**Mentorship**

_Co-supervisor_, The University of Sydney. (2018)

I co-supervised an Animal and Veterinary Bioscience Honours student researching the effect of time since prescribed burning on small mammal and tick activity in urban bushland. I assisted with fieldwork activities (small mammal trapping and microhabitat surveys) and coordinated volunteers and the wildlife anaesthesia training required for the project. I mentored the student during the project design phase and provided feedback on their final manuscript and presentation.
